### **Save the date - registration opening soon!**
Learn how to create dynamic, reproducible reports using Quarto to enhance transparency and automation in your research workflows. 

**The next online workshop will take place from 2-4pm on Wednesday 22nd April 2026.**

This on-line workshop introduces you to Quarto, a scientific and
technical publishing system designed to facilitate reproducible working
practices by allowing you to integrate code, results, and narrative text
in a single document. Quarto supports multiple programming languages,
including R, Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript.

The workshop will be taught using R and RStudio, but the concepts are
applicable to other programming languages supported by Quarto. Some
familiarity with the layout of RStudio and beginner level knowledge of R
is assumed.

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to transform raw
data into a professional, polished report (HTML, Word, or PDF) where the
text and analysis remain in sync. We will use the
[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) data on global development to
demonstrate how to produce a reproducible country profile report that
analyses the relationship between wealth (GDP per capita) and health
(Life Expectancy) over the last 50 years.

## Pre-requisites 

To participate in this course, you will need a computer with internet access.

To follow along with the activities with the instructor, you will need R and RStudio installed on your computer, or access to Posit Cloud, an online platform for R and RStudio. You will also need some R packages and optionally, a lateX distribution if you want to create PDF reports.

If you are using a computer provided by your organisation you may need your IT department to install the software. If that is not possible, you can use Posit Cloud instead.

[View guidance](https://ukri-digital-research-skills-catalyst.github.io/quarto-intro/before.html) to install R and Rstudio or use Posit Cloud. 


## Learning objectives

Participants will learn how to:

-   Construct a structured Quarto (.qmd) document using YAML headers to
    define metadata (title, author, table of contents).
-   Format narrative text using Markdown syntax to create headers,
    lists, and emphasis without relying on word processor GUIs.
-   Integrate R code chunks into prose to produce tables and
    visualizations directly within the document.
-   Implement "Inline Code" to insert dynamic statistics (e.g., specific
    means or *p*-values) directly into sentences, ensuring numbers
    update automatically if the data changes.
-   Control report output using "Chunk Options" to hide raw code from
    the final reader while keeping the results visible.
-   Render a single source document into multiple output formats (HTML
    for web, MS Word for collaboration, or PDF for publication).
