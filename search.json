Researchers training needs are supported at a practical level, through the provision of the following features:\n\nA searchable Learning portal to high quality resources developed through UKRI funding\nConsultation service - access guidance from digital research specialists\nWorkshops and events - occasional online and in-person events to facilitate networking and address training needs\n\n\n\nLearning portal\n\nThe learning portal has 80+ learning resources, providing a centralised and easily accessible hub to accelerate learning for UK based researchers and innovators. Designed to save time and enhance the user’s learning experience, the portal allows users to quickly locate resources tailored to their expertise, research area, and preferred study mode. Current training resources focus on building digital research skills for bioscientists and health professionals, with plans to expand the offering with additional materials in the future.\n\n\n\nExplore the learning portal\n\n\n\nConsultancy service\n\nWe are pleased to offer a consultancy service where online sessions can be booked with our Digital Research Specialists. Our experts provide tailored support to help you overcome challenges and enhance your research at any stage of your project.\nWhether you need assistance with troubleshooting code, tackling analytical problems, or seeking general guidance and advice, our specialists are here to help.\nOur consultancy service covers a broad range of research needs, including:\n\nExperimental design\nData processing and management\nData analysis and interpretation\nMedical image acquisition, analysis, and management\nBig data skills and ’omics for health sciences\nHigh Performance Computing for ’omics\nData stewardship\nMachine learning for health & biosciences\nData science and statistics\nRobotics for plant phenotyping\n\nBook a session today and get the expert support you need to move your research forward with confidence. For further details on the service please visit Consult an Expert.\n\nEvents and bespoke training service\n\nTraining events are offered on an ad-hoc basis, both online and in person. These engaging sessions are offered at a reduced rate or completely free of charge, led by experienced instructors who are passionate about sharing their knowledge. We’re committed to creating a welcoming and accessible learning space for everyone in the research community. Scholarships are available to support travel and care costs, helping to ensure that everyone can participate. Wherever possible, sessions will be delivered online to maximise accessibility.\nA full-day training conference, AI Readiness in the Biosciences, will take place on Friday 4th September 2026 in York. Attendance is free, and bursaries are available to support travel and care costs.\n\n\n\nAI readiness in the Biosciences\n\n\nFor further details visit News and Events.\n\nBespoke training\n\nIf your team or organisation requires a bespoke training session on one of the topics detailed in our learning portal please get in touch. A tailored course to suit your team’s learning needs and budget can be organised. Please note this option is only available for the courses indicated in the learning portal.\nFor further details on the service please visit the Learning Portal.\n\nProject history and funding\n\nLed by Professor Emma Rand at the University of York, the Catalyst Project was developed in response to the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme funding call. It brings together seven university partners in a collaborative effort to centralise high-quality training materials for researchers and innovators.\nThe project builds on resources created by Data Science in Healthcare & Biosciences (DaSH), which developed training materials and hosted events between 2021 and 2023 to upskill health and bioscience researchers in data management and analysis. The Catalyst now centralises access to materials from seven of the nine DaSH projects, creating a single hub for researchers to access these resources.\nThe project originally focussed on health and bioscience researchers, the Catalyst aims to reach a broader audience. Its digital research skills training resources are also highly relevant for researchers in arts and humanities, sciences, and social sciences, providing opportunities to enhance digital expertise across disciplines.\n\n\n\nProject history\n\n\n\nThe Seven DaSH projects contributing data to this project\n\n\nProject\nResearch theme\nInstitution\nLead\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Bioscience IDEAS\nMedical image acquisition, analysis, management\nUniversity College London\nDavid Cash\n\n\nData Campp\nRobotics for plant phenotyping\nUniversity of Nottingham, University of Lincoln\nAndrew French, Elizabeth Sklar\n\n\nELIXIR-UK: FAIR data stewardship training\nData Stewardship in Life Sciences\nUniversity of Bradford, Cardiff University\nKrzysztof Poterlowicz\n\n\nEnabling the big data revolution\nHealth data science and omics\nKing’s College London\nRebecca Oakey\n\n\nLearn to Discover (L2D)\nData science and ML for health and bioscience\nUniversity College London\nGeraint Thomas\n\n\nCloud-SPAN\nCloud High-Performance Computing for Environmental ’omics\nUniversity of York and Software, Sustainability Institute\nEmma Rand, James Chong\n\n\nEd-DaSH\nData science training for bioscience and health\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nGiacomo Peru\n\n\n\nThe Catalyst Project is funded by UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme from October 2024 to March 2027.
