A tailored course to suit your team’s learning needs and budget can be organised. Please note this option is only available for the courses indicated in the learning portal.\nFor further details on the service please visit the Learning Portal.\n\nProject history and funding\n\nLed by Professor Emma Rand at the University of York, the Catalyst Project was developed in response to the UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme funding call. It brings together seven university partners in a collaborative effort to centralise high-quality training materials for researchers and innovators.\nThe project builds on resources created by Data Science in Healthcare & Biosciences (DaSH), which developed training materials and hosted events between 2021 and 2023 to upskill health and bioscience researchers in data management and analysis. The Catalyst now centralises access to materials from seven of the nine DaSH projects, creating a single hub for researchers to access these resources.\nThe project originally focussed on health and bioscience researchers, the Catalyst aims to reach a broader audience. Its digital research skills training resources are also highly relevant for researchers in arts and humanities, sciences, and social sciences, providing opportunities to enhance digital expertise across disciplines.\n\nThe Seven DaSH projects contributing data to this project\n\n\nProject\nResearch theme\nInstitution\nLead\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Bioscience IDEAS\nMedical image acquisition, analysis, management\nUniversity College London\nDavid Cash\n\n\nData Campp\nRobotics for plant phenotyping\nUniversity of Nottingham, University of Lincoln\nAndrew French, Elizabeth Sklar\n\n\nELIXIR-UK: FAIR data stewardship training\nData Stewardship in Life Sciences\nUniversity of Bradford, Cardiff University\nKrzysztof Poterlowicz\n\n\nEnabling the big data revolution\nHealth data science and omics\nKing’s College London\nRebecca Oakey\n\n\nLearn to Discover (L2D)\nData science and ML for health and bioscience\nUniversity College London\nGeraint Thomas\n\n\nCloud-SPAN\nCloud High-Performance Computing for Environmental ’omics\nUniversity of York and Software, Sustainability Institute\nEmma Rand, James Chong\n\n\nEd-DaSH\nData science training for bioscience and health\nUniversity of Edinburgh\nGiacomo Peru\n\n\n\nThe Catalyst Project is funded by UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure Programme from October 2024 to March 2027.
